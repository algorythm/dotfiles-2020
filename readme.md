# Automated Dotfiles Scripts

This repository includes my personal configs. This is supposed to replace
my original projects for doing so:

- [dotfiles](https://github.com/algorythm/dotfiles)
- [new-dotfiles](https://github.com/algorythm/main-dotfiles)

This is my 2020 config which should be totally up to date with what's actually
necessary, without too much clutter.
