# Automated Dotfiles Scripts

This repository includes my personal configs. This is supposed to replace
my original projects for doing so:

- [dotfiles](https://github.com/algorythm/dotfiles)
- [new-dotfiles](https://github.com/algorythm/new-dotfiles)
- [dotfiles old](https://github.com/algorythm/dotfiles.old)
- [dotbot](https://github.com/algorythm/dotbot)
- [this dotfiles fork](https://github.com/algorythm/dotbot)

(yes I know, it's completely ridiculous - i'm trying to do better)

This is my ~~2020~~ 2022 config which should be totally up to date with what's actually
necessary, without too much clutter.
